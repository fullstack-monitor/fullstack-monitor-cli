See https://fb.me/react-unsafe-component-lifecycles for details.\n\n* Move data fetching code or side effects to componentDidUpdate.\n* If you're updating state whenever props change, refactor your code to use memoization techniques or move it to static getDerivedStateFromProps.

In React 17.x, only the UNSAFE_ name will work. To rename all deprecated lifecycles to their new names, you can run `npx react-codemod rename-unsafe-lifecycles` in your project source folder.\n\nPlease update the following components: Router"},"stack":["at console._collect (webpack-internal:///./client/ultimate-logger/ultimate-logger.js:27:11)","at printWarning (webpack-internal:///./node_modules/react-dom/cjs/react-dom.development.js:12357:15)","at lowPriorityWarningWithoutStack (webpack-internal:///./node_modules/react-dom/cjs/react-dom.development.js:12378:20)","at Object.ReactStrictModeWarnings.flushPendingUnsafeLifecycleWarnings (webpack-internal:///./node_modules/react-dom/cjs/react-dom.development.js:12548:7)","at flushRenderPhaseStrictModeWarningsInDEV (webpack-internal:///./node_modules/react-dom/cjs/react-dom.development.js:25689:31)","at commitRootImpl (webpack-internal:///./node_modules/react-dom/cjs/react-dom.development.js:24937:3)","at unstable_runWithPriority (webpack-internal:///./node_modules/scheduler/cjs/scheduler.development.js:697:12)","at runWithPriority$2 (webpack-internal:///./node_modules/react-dom/cjs/react-dom.development.js:12149:10)"]},{"type":"log","timestamp":"Fri, 26 Mar 2021 02:18:42 GMT","arguments":{"0":"Component mounted from App.jsx"},"stack":["at console._collect (webpack-internal:///./client/ultimate-logger/ultimate-logger.js:27:11)","at App.componentDidMount (webpack-internal:///./client/App.jsx:74:15)","at commitLifeCycles (webpack-internal:///./node_modules/react-dom/cjs/react-dom.development.js:22101:22)","at commitLayoutEffects (webpack-internal:///./node_modules/react-dom/cjs/react-dom.development.js:25344:7)","at HTMLUnknownElement.callCallback (webpack-internal:///./node_modules/react-dom/cjs/react-dom.development.js:336:14)","at Object.invokeGuardedCallbackDev (webpack-internal:///./node_modules/react-dom/cjs/react-dom.development.js:385:16)","at invokeGuardedCallback (webpack-internal:///./node_modules/react-dom/cjs/react-dom.development.js:440:31)","at commitRootImpl (webpack-internal:///./node_modules/react-dom/cjs/react-dom.development.js:25082:9)"]},{"type":"info","timestamp":"Fri, 26 Mar 2021 02:18:43 GMT","arguments":{"0":"[WDS] Hot Module Replacement enabled."},"stack":["at console._collect (webpack-internal:///./client/ultimate-logger/ultimate-logger.js:27:11)","at Object.hot (webpack-internal:///./node_modules/webpack-dev-server/client/index.js?http://localhost:8080:48:9)","at eval (webpack-internal:///./node_modules/webpack-dev-server/client/socket.js:47:25)","at SockJS.sock.onmessage (webpack-internal:///./node_modules/webpack-dev-server/client/clients/SockJSClient.js:63:9)","at SockJS.EventTarget.dispatchEvent (webpack-internal:///./node_modules/sockjs-client/dist/sockjs.js:170:20)","at eval (webpack-internal:///./node_modules/sockjs-client/dist/sockjs.js:888:16)","at Array.forEach (<anonymous>)","at SockJS._transportMessage (webpack-internal:///./node_modules/sockjs-client/dist/sockjs.js:886:17)"]}]
